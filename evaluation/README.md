# Model evaluation code

This folder contains our model evaluation code. This uses one jupyter notebook, BART_Project_Evaluation.ipynb which is used for our manual evaluation. 

'factcc_rouge.py' is used to generate our FactCC and Rouge metrics and can be run independently. However, to run FactCC the user first needs to follow the instructions here and download the model checkpoints https://github.com/salesforce/factCC.
